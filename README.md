# NewHiddenBar

**NewHiddenBar** is a maintained continuation of the original [Hidden Bar](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden) by [Dwarves Foundation](https://github.com/dwarvesf), an ultra-light macOS utility that hides menu bar items to give your Mac a cleaner look.

The upstream project has been inactive for an extended period. This fork picks up where it left off — merging the most-requested community fixes, resolving the memory leak affecting macOS Sequoia and Tahoe, repairing the Preferences window on modern macOS, and keeping the app compatible with current macOS releases.

## What's new in 2.0

- **Memory leak fix.** Addresses the runaway leak that was growing Hidden Bar to multiple GB on macOS Sequoia and Tahoe. Adapted from community PRs #335 and #346 with additional refinements.
- **Ultrawide and multi-monitor support.** Collapse width is now computed from the widest connected display (up to macOS's 10,000 pt maximum) and collapsed state is preserved across display connect/disconnect events.
- **Preferences window rebuilt for macOS 26 Tahoe.** Compact titlebar with a centered General/About pill, no more transparent-titlebar bleed-through, no more stray "Custom View" labels.
- **Additional localizations.** Italian, Ukrainian, and Turkish added to the existing ten languages.
- **Minimum macOS raised to 13 (Ventura).** Aligns with Apple's currently-supported macOS releases as of 2026 and lets the codebase drop a stack of `#available` checks, the legacy upstream PNG icon assets, and several compatibility branches that targeted macOS 10.13 → 12. A migration to `SMAppService` for launch-at-login is planned next, which will also retire the LauncherApplication helper target.
- **Rebranded with full attribution.** App name is now "NewHiddenBar" and the About screen credits both Dwarves Foundation and this fork's maintainer.
- **"Enable always hidden section" applies immediately** (2.1.1). It previously needed an app restart before the second separator would appear.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full release notes.

## Install

### Manual download

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/small32/NewHiddenBar/releases/latest)
- Drag **NewHiddenBar.app** to your `/Applications` folder
- Launch it and drag the icon in your menu bar (hold `⌘`) to the right so it sits between some other icons

### Mac App Store

Coming soon. The fork is being prepared for Mac App Store submission under a new listing; the original upstream app currently on the Store is stale and under Dwarves Foundation's account.

## Usage

- `⌘` + drag to move icons around in the menu bar, including into and out of NewHiddenBar's hidden section
- Click the arrow icon to collapse / expand the hidden section
- Optional global hotkey for toggling, configurable in Preferences → General
- Option-click the arrow icon to show / hide the separators themselves
- Preferences → General → **Enable always hidden section** adds a second separator. Icons you `⌘` + drag to the far side of it stay hidden even when the bar is expanded — they are only revealed by option-clicking the arrow icon

## Requirements

- macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
- Apple Silicon and Intel both supported (universal binary)

## Building from source

```
git clone https://github.com/small32/NewHiddenBar.git
cd NewHiddenBar
./scripts/install.sh
```

`scripts/install.sh` builds the Release configuration, gracefully quits any running instance, replaces `/Applications/NewHiddenBar.app`, and launches the fresh build. Pass `--no-launch` to skip launching, or `--debug` to build the Debug configuration instead.

Alternatively, open `Hidden Bar.xcodeproj` in Xcode, set your Development Team under Signing & Capabilities, and run.

## Contributing

Bug reports and focused PRs are welcome. The goal of this fork is to keep NewHiddenBar working — not to add major new features. Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a PR.
